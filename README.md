# Biomes
This project includes a WPF visualizer and a class library (WIP) that uses Wave Function Collapse to generate a map of biomes that are defined in a SQLite database.  The WFC algorithm generates a random map and the user may click on the map to define a start point and end point, which will then generate a path using A-Star where the costs for traversing the tiles are pulled from the biome values in the database.

The intention of this project is that it will be incorporated into my other AIEconomy project to form that basis of a game where players attempt to dominate the economy against AI agents through trade strategy, careful placement of trading posts and resource collection as well an options to disrupt supply chain to impact the economy.
